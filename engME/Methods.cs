            PlugNameIn("Emma",true,true,"F",1,2000,"German","Emeline, Em, Emmy, Milly, Emily","universal","Emma has now been the most popular name in the United States for four years in a row, claiming the crown again for 2017. Emma has done handsprings up the charts thanks to a legion of Emma heroines, from Bovary to Goldman to Jane Austen's protagonist, along with famous modern Emmas such as Emma Stone and Emma Watson. Parents who have turned from Emily to Emma seeking something more distinctive will have to keep looking.\n\r Emma was given a big boost among popular girls' names when it was given to Rachel and Ross's baby on Friends in 2002.\n\r Emma is simple but has deep history, is streamlined and modern-feeling yet distinctly feminine. It's hard to find all those qualities combined in one name, which is exactly why so many parents (over 17,000 last year) have chosen Emma and made it the top girls' name.\n\r Parents who love Emma but think it's overexposed have been moving to such alternatives as Amelia, Emilia, Amelie, Emmeline, and Ella. But, of course, these names might be poised to move up and take Emma's place near the top of the list.\n\r A very old royal name well used throughout the centuries (Queen Emma married King Ethelred the Unready in 1002), Emma is also historically associated with Lady Hamilton, the mistress of Lord Nelson and muse of painter George Romney.\n\r It's worth noting that Emma, Emily, and the new British Number 1 Amelia all derive from different roots and have different meanings. But they continue to feel like very similar names.\n\r Three of the hottest young female stars share the name: Emma Watson, Emma Roberts, and Emma (born Emily) Stone.");
            PlugNameIn("Olivia",true,true,"F",0,2010,"Latin","Nollie, Livia, Ollie","olive tree","Olivia, a lovely Shakespearean name with an admirable balance of strength and femininity, is one of the most popular girls' names in the world. Like her sisters Isabella and Sophia, Olivia is a megapopular name not only in the US but in the UK, Australia, Canada, and throughout the Wester World. Olivia is currently the Number 2 name for baby girls in the US, and could be heading towards the very top of the list -- so don't say we didn't warn you.\n\r In the UK, Olivia was the recent Number 1 girls' name in tandem with twin brother Oliver at the top of the charts. It is still the top girls' name in Canada and Number 4 in both Australia and Scotland.\n\r Olivia was first popularized by Shakespeare's Twelfth Night as the name of the pampered, wealthy countess. In ancient Greece, the olive was a symbol of Athena as well as a token of peace and fertility, and olive wreaths were awarded to the winners at the Olympic games.\n\r Olivia has been a popular starbaby name for fifteen years, and has also been a well-used TV character name, such as in Olivia Benson on Law & Order SVU and the current powerful lead Olivia Pope on Scandal.\n\r Golden Age star Olivia de Havilland was influential in bringing the name to U.S. attention, followed by Olivia Newton-John, and now we have Olivias Wilde, Munn and Williams. If you love popular girls' names, Olivia might be the perfect choice for you, but parents in search of a distinctive name will have to keep looking. Some related alternatives: Olive, Livia, Liv.");
            PlugNameIn("Ava",true,true,"F",2,2000,"Latin","Avarilla, Rilla","life","Ava was given a huge popularity boost -- Ava's currently the Number 3 girl name -- when dozens of high-profile stars such as Reese Witherspoon and Hugh Jackman chose Ava for their daughters. This Glamour Girl name via Hollywood beauty Ava Gardner is attractive but epidemically popular!\n\r Some parents who love Ava's simplicity and style have looked on to other choices that might take her place: Eva, Avery, Ada, Aveline and so on. The result, as with other popular names such as Hailey and Aiden that have spawned a raft of imitators, is that Ava is beginning to feel even more ubiquitous than it might based on its Top 5 standing.\n\r Ava seemed to be headed towards Number 1 -- it's no accident we titled our most recent book on baby name style Beyond Ava & Aiden -- but, though it seems to have been somewhat side-swiped by the Olivia-Isabella-Sophia group, it will still certainly stay in the Top 10 for years to come. It's a lovely name on many levels, but if you want something that will stand out, keep looking.\n\r One of the most fascinating things about Ava is that it's a much more ancient name than its modern-feeling sleekness would suggest. St. Ava was the daughter of King Pepin and was cured of blindness and became a nun.\n\r While Ava Gardner represents the Golden Age of Hollywood image of the name, director Ava DuVernay updates it to new Hollywood, together showcasing the name's attractive mix of sexiness and strength.");
            PlugNameIn("Isabella",true,true,"F",0,2010,"Spanish","Bella, Belle, Arabella","pledged to God","Isabella is a major superstar among popular girls' names. Isabella was the top girls' name in the US for two years running- from 2009 to 2010--due at least in part to the 'Twilight' effect and lead character Isabella 'Bella' Swan.\n\r Isabella has incredible cross-cultural appeal, feeling both modern and traditional, and is popular among parents ranging from Anglophile to Hispanic, and more feminine and romantic than Isabel. An amazing success story for a name that wasn't even in the Top 1000 in the 1980's.\n\r Part of the reason Isabella is so successful is that it appeals in a wide variety of ways to a large number of parents. It's feminine but also classic, has a long history as a royal and classic Spanish name for girls yet is comfortable on the international stage. Some parents choose it to get to the short form Bella, while others prefer to use the irreverent Izzy or Issy, while still others insist on using it in its full four-syllable glory.\n\r Isabella is familiar through various European queens, and was used by Shakespeare in Measure for Measure.\n\r Variations Isabelle and Isabel are also popular, with the Scottish spelling Isobel another possibility. A little further afield is the smoosh name Isabetta, which was chosen by Amber and Rob Mariano.");
            PlugNameIn("Sophia",true,true,"F",0,2010,"Greek","Sophie","wisdom","Sophia, which was the Number 1 girls' name in the US from 2011 to 2013, is among the most popular girls' names in the Western World, with a sensuous sound and high-minded meaning. Sophia's been chosen by several celeb parents, and reached the top of the charts without losing any -- okay, much -- of its sophisticated beauty. Sophia's a real winner.\n\r Like its sister baby names Isabella and Olivia, Sophia has gained widespread favor by appealing to a broad range of parents: Intellectuals who like it for its meaning and those attracted to its femininity, parents who want a classic name and those looking for a name with Latin roots --the Sofia spelling is also popular. Sophie is the French version of the name, more popular than Sophia in some parts of the world. Legend Sophia Loren was originally Sofia.\n\r The name was first famous via St. Sophia, venerated in the Greek Orthodox church--St Sophia was the mother of three daughters named Faith, Hope and Love. It was first used in England in the seventeenth century and was the name of George I's both mother and wife.\n\r Sophia has been an author favorite from the days of early novelists like Henry Fielding (Tom Jones) and Jane Austen (Persuasion) to the TV scriptwriters of today (The Walking Dead, Orange is the New Black).\n\r Sophia's only downside is its huge popularity; it's actually even more popular than it appears, because alternate spelling Sofia falls at Number 14 on the US popularity chart. Alternative baby names you might want to consider: Sophie, Seraphina, Susannah, Zofia.");
            PlugNameIn("Mia",true,true,"F",2,2010,"Italian","Mimi","mine; bitter","Mia is an appealingly unfussy multicultural name that has enjoyed a meteoric rise up the charts and is now firmly among the ten most popular girls' names.\n\r Mia's success is largely attributable to Mia Farrow--born Maria. Her name entered the Top 1000 for the first time in 1964, the very year that Farrow gained wide attention for her role on the nighttime soap Peyton Place.\n\r We see Mia as the daughter of Nina, or maybe Maya, and the granddaughter of Mary: a name that has something for nearly everyone. It works for the parent who wants a name that is simple and modern, and for those who seek a name with genuine depth given that it springs from Maria. Mia sidesteps all the curlicues and ruffles attached to names like Isabella and Olivia, yet it's distinctly feminine.\n\r And in some ways, Mia doesn't feel as trendy as its popularity standing might indicate. It's a likable yet not really stand-out, a compromise choice for a lot of parents. Alternatives include a wide range of rhyming names that are less popular: Leah, Tea, Thea, Gia, Nia, Pia.\n\r Kate Winslet is the mother of Mia Honey, and Ian Ziering is dad to Mia Loren.\n\r Mia is also an Italian word meaning 'mine.'");
            PlugNameIn("Charlotte",true,true,"F",0,2010,"French","Char, Sherry, Lottie, Lotta","free man","The name of the young Princess of Cambridge, Charlotte is the latest classic name to join Sophia, Emma, Olivia, and Isabella in a rise toward the top of the list, and it is now among the most popular girl names.\n\r Charlotte is an elegant royal name, with a host of widely varied role models, from Charlotte Brontv to the spidery protagonist of E. B. White's Charlotte's Web to the more recent Charlotte York, aka the prissy one, of Sex and the City. Charlotte is appealing to a wide range of parents because it sounds feminine yet grownup, sophisticated yet lush.\n\r The name was popularized by England's Queen Charlotte Sophia, wife of King George III who ruled in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, was the mother of fifteen children, and a patron of Mozart and Bach; Charlotte and George ruled England during the French and American revolutions.\n\r Charlotte is now a pop culture staple  it was Scarlett Johansson's character in Lost in Translation and has been featured on TV shows like Lost and Revenge. The band Good Charlotte was named for a children's book with that title. An all-around winner of a name, Charlotte has been chosen by Chelsea Clinton, Dylan McDermott, Colin Hanks, and Sarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze Jr.\n\r In addition to Charlie, Lottie makes a cute nickname.");
            PlugNameIn("Amelia",true,true,"F",0,2010,"German","Amy, Mel, Millie, Emily","work","Amelia, a lovely Victorian name, with a heroic connection to aviatrix Amelia Earhart, is one of the hottest girls' names as an alternative to the overused Emily and Amanda. Amelia emerged as the top British name in 2011 and retains the Number 1 spot, and in 2017 vaulted into the US Top 10 for the first time. Amelia is also a Top 10 girls' name in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, Scotland and Polands. So while Emilia and Emelia are sound-alike names closer to the mega-popular Emma and Emily, it's the Amelia version that's on the fast track.\n\r Kids might associate Amelia with the wacky children's book character Amelia Bedelia, while adults could appreciate its Shakespearean cred as a character in A Comedy of Errors--spelled Aemilia, as well as as the eponymous heroine of the Henry Fielding novel, and also appearing in novels by Trollope and Thackeray, as a Harry Potter name, and as detective Amelia Peabody in the Elizabeth Peters series. Angelina Jolie played patrol cop Amelia Donaghy in The Bone Collector.\n\r Amelia became a British royal name via the daughters of Kings George II and III. An American hero is feminist Amelia Bloomer.\n\r Trivia tidbit: Amelia is the birth name of Minnie Driver.");
            PlugNameIn("Evelyn",true,true,"F",0,1920,"English","Evelina, Ev, Eve","wished for child","After decades of disuse, soft and feminine Evelyn has returned to the baby name stage in a huge way. It reached the Top 10 for the first time in 2017. Evelyn has now surpassed its former heights, joining a legion of contemporary little Evas, Avas, Eves, Evies, and Evelines. All this despite having returned to the Top 40 for the first time since 1939 less than a decade ago.\n\r Originally a masculine name, its most famous bearer is writer Evelyn Waugh. (Trivia note: Evelyn Waugh was married to a woman named Evelyn, and they were known as 'He-Evelyn' and 'She-Evelyn'.) Its quiet persona was reversed with the character Evelyn Salt, played by Angelina Jolie. Recently, Bruce Willis chose it for his fifth daughter, and more recently Carey Mulligan used it for hers.");
            PlugNameIn("Abigail",true,true,"F",0,2000,"Hebrew","Abbie, Abby","my father is joyful","Abigail is an Old Testament name  she was the wife of David, renowned for her beauty, wisdom, and prophetic powers  that became a term for a maid in the early nineteenth century, which led to a fall from favor. Now, Abigail's back in a big way  it's been among the Top 10 girls' names for several years  favored for its slightly proper vintage charm.\n\r One of the most classic Hebrew names for girls, Abigail has been the name of two of our First Ladies  three, if you count the character on The West Wing  and Abby has been the name of a host of television and movie characters  she has been seen on screen in everything from Mad Men to The Lovely Bones.\n\r Abigail's biblical roots and her sensible image combined with cute, accessible nickname Abby make her popularity understandable.\n\r If you like Abigail but want something fresher, you may consider such other biblical choices as Lydia and Priscilla or names popular in Revolutionary Era America that have been neglected in recent years, such as Susannah and Eliza.");
            PlugNameIn("Harper",true,true,"A",2,2010,"English","Harp, Harrah, Harry","harp player","Harper is a red hot name for girls, having jumped from obscurity to near the top of the popularity list in less than a decade; it entered the Top 10 for the first time in 2015, and has stayed near there since. Harper is a prime example of the trend of surnames that turn into boys' names and then become girls' names. Harper was rarely heard for either sex before the mid-2000s, entering the girls' list in 2004. (For boys, it was in use until 1906 when it dropped off the scope and didn't reappear until a full century later.)\n\r Harper has been a shooting star in the celebrisphere, chosen first by Ali Wentworth and George Stephanopoulis, followed by Lisa Marie Presley, David Spade, Dave Grohl, Martie Maguire, Tiffani Thiessen, Bill Hader and Neil Patrick Harris. And since the Beckhams have chosen it for their first daughter, Harper is sure to get even hotter.\n\r It was To Kill a Mockingbird author Harper (born Nelle Harper) Lee who brought this family name into the public consciousness as a female first name with offbeat, boyish southern charm, and it's also a name with a musical bent. Harper has recently been used as a female character name on such hot TV shows as Gossip Girls and The Wizards of Waverly Place.");
            PlugNameIn("Emily",true,true,"F",0,1990,"German","Amelia, Amy, Mel, Millie","rival","Emily may have dropped somewhat in the current standings, but it was the most popular girls' name for over a decade because it appeals on many levels: Emily is feminine, classic, simple, pretty, and strong. It also has those nice literary namesakes, like Emily Dickinson and Emily Brontv.\n\r Parents who a decade ago might have chosen Emily have moved on to Emma  which currently holds the Number One crown  and now are looking at such alternatives as Amelia and Emmeline. But those girls' names, like Emma, may soon feel overused too.\n\r Modern Emilys in the spotlight include a number of the hottest young actresses  Emily Blunt, Emily Mortimer, Emily Deschanel  and even Emma Stone was christened Emily.");
            PlugNameIn("Elizabeth",true,true,"F",0,1990,"Hebrew","Beth, Betsy, Betty","pledged to God","Elizabeth, one of the premiere classic girls' names and most popular Hebrew names for girls, is now just outside the Top 10, having been replaced in 2014 by the rising Charlotte. Yet Elizabeth has so much going for it  rich history, broad appeal, and timeless style  that no matter how many little girls there are named Lizzie, Eliza, and Beth out there, you can still make Elizabeth your own.\n\r Elizabeth nicknames on the table today include Libby, Bess, Tibby, and even the so-antiquated-it's-cool Betty. Also in play is the fashionable Eliza. There has been only one year since 1880 that Elizabeth slipped one place below the Top 25, and that was in 1945  when Betty was Number 11.\n\r In the Bible, Elizabeth was the mother of John the Baptist, and two of England's most notable queens have been Elizabeth I and II. Another memorable bearer was Elizabeth Taylor  who hated to be called Liz.\n\r The Elisabeth spelling, found in several cultures, is represented by such notables as Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, Elisabeth Shue, Elisabeth Moss, and Elisabeth Hasselbeck. Elisabeth is nicknamed Bethsy in Buddenbrooks, Bep in The Diary of Anne Frank, and Betsy in Wolverine.");
            PlugNameIn("Avery",false,true,"A",2,2010,"American","Ree","ruler of the elves","Though this unisex name has been around for a few decades, Avery is now a hot one for girls, partly as an alternative to the epidemic Ava. The female Avery has had a meteoric rise, moving up from Number 802 in 1990 to just outside the Top 10 in recent years.\n\r Angie Harmon and Jason Sehorn may have started it all when they chose it for their daughter in 2005, just as they did with daughters Finley and Emery. Amy Locane used the name in 2009 and now Dr. Phil has a granddaughter named Avery.\n\r On 30 Rock, Elizabeth Banks had an extended cameo playing Alec Baldwin's glamorous fiancee, Avery Jessup.");

Macy all named their daughters Sofia. The Sofia, vs. Sophia, spelling is widely used throughout Europe, in Italy, Spain, and throughout Scandinavia and Eastern Europe. Sofia is the Number One girls' name in Italy and in the Top Ten in Chile, Denmark, and Spain. In the U.S., the Sophia spelling ranks Number 5, but Sofia is now just outside the Top 10.");
            PlugNameIn("Ella",true,true,"F",2,2010,"German","Ellen","all, completely; fairy maiden","Following in the path of Emma and Isabella/Bella, Ella shot up the charts in the new millennium: it rose from Number 265 in 2000 to a high of Number 15 in 2013 and has stayed just outside the US Top 10.\n\r Ella has long been a fave of the glitterati -- including the John Travoltas, the Warren Beattys, Ben Stiller, Eric Clapton, Jeff Gordon, Ioan Gruffudd, Alex Rodriguez, and Mark Wahlberg.\n\r Iconic singer Ella Fitzgerald adds a jazzy edge. One other appeal of Ella: It sounds both vintage and modern at the same time. Although it hadn't been used much for a few generation and so sounds fresh, there are an awful lot of little girls named Ella running around -- along with those called Ellie and Bella. So while it has much to recommend it, don't say we didn't warn you about Ella Enchanted's popularity.\n\r And her popularity isn't limited to the US: Ella is Number 4 in Sweden and Number 6 in Australia.");

Still others have moved on to similar choices Addison and Madelyn. While those names may continue to rise, Madison is definitely on a downward trend.");

Sylvester Stallone's third 'S' daughter, following Sophia and Sistine, is Scarlet (one 't', as in the color) and The White Stripes' Jack White and Karen Elson also have a Scarlett, as do Molly Sims and Rob Schneider. The Mick Jaggers were ahead of the curve when they chose Scarlett for the middle name of their daughter Elizabeth in 1984.\n\r In the Margaret Mitchell novel, Scarlett was the main character's grandmother's maiden name -- she was actually named Katie O'Hara. The name entered the Top 1000 in 1940, a year after the movie of Gone With the Wind was released. Scarlett has continued its winning streak, and is now firmly in the Top 20.\n\r One of the leading characters on TV's Nashville is named Scarlett O'Connor.");

In the 1990s, Victoria managed to breach the Top 20, a surprisingly high standing for a name that is more of a classic than a fashion favorite these days, and it has retained its popularity. One enduring appeal of Victoria is that it's a traditional girls' name with a powerful meaning.\n\r Victoria is the ancient Roman goddess of victory, the equivalent of the Greek Nike, and also a popular third century saint.\n\r One possible role model is proto-feminist Victoria Woodhull. Ex-Spice Girl Victoria Beckham and Victoria's Secret have given the name a more modern edge, and it also has been a Twilight name.\n\r While Vicky (and Vicki, Vickie, and Vikki) and Tory (along with Tori) have traditionally been used as nicknames for Victoria, contemporary parents might want to consider Plum, as in the Victoria plum. Vittoria is the pretty Italian version.");

Aria entered the list in 2000 and has risen since then to the Top 25. Aria's literal meaning, air, is meant as a musical term denoting a kind of song or melody.\n\r Television is definitely helping to popularize the name, with a character on Pretty Little Liars named Aria and Game of Thrones featuring a young heroine named Arya, itself a Top 200 name at this point.\n\r Aria is also a saint's name.");

It existed as Gracia in the Middle Ages, but was not in common use until the Puritans adopted it along with other Christian attribute names in the sixteenth century. Embraced by Americans of the Victorian era, it was the eleventh most popular name in this country in 1875.\n\r Grace is currently even more popular in other countries than it is here  it's ranked highly in Northern Ireland, Ireland, England and Wales, Australia, Scotland, and Canada.\n\r If Grace is too overused for you, consider an exotic variation like Engracia or Graziella.

The creative spelling Khloe has been moving up as well, thanks solely to the Kardashian klan.\n\r While Chloe has not been used for any recent celebrity babies, it is the name of the now-grown daughters of Olivia Newton-John and of Candice Bergen and the late French film director Louis Malle. Actress and style leader Chloe Sevigny is another high-profile bearer, as is rising young star Chloe Grace Moretz.\n\r Chloe appeared in Greek mythology as an alternative name for the goddess of agriculture and fertility, Demeter, and in the Greek pastoral romance Daphnis and Chloe.
